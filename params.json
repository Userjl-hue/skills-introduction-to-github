  "body": "### Welcome to the Thirty Meter Telescope SysML model\r\nThe Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT)system that is currently being\r\ndeveloped by the TMT Observatory Corporation. The main objective for the TMT related\r\nanalysis is to provide state-dependent power roll-ups\r\nfor different operational scenarios and demonstrate that requirements are satisfied by the design as well as mass roll-ups and duration analysis of the operational use cases.\r\n\r\n![TMT](http://ec2-52-8-144-112.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/Large/images/gallery/top%20view%20of%20tmt%20complex.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe core of the system is a wide-field,altitude-azimuth\r\nRitchey-Chretien telescope with a 492 segment, 30 meter diameter primary mirror, a fully active secondary mirror and an\r\narticulated tertiary mirror. The Alignment and Phasing System is a Shack-Hartmann\r\n(SH) wavefront sensor responsible for the overall pre-adaptive optics wavefront quality of the\r\nTMT.\r\n\r\nThe model is built with an approach to model-based\r\nsystems analysis with SysML that is both rigorous and automated. The approach supports the kind of system analysis we mentioned\r\nearlier, i.e., requirements verification. The approach’s rigor is established with a modeling\r\nmethod that is an extension of INCOSE’s Object Oriented Systems Engineering\r\nMethod (OOSEM). The extension, dubbed Executable System\r\nEngineering Method (ESEM), proposes a set of analysis design patterns that are specified with\r\nvarious SysML structural, behavioral and parametric diagrams. The purpose of the patterns spans\r\nthe formalization of requirements, traceability between requirements and design artifacts,\r\nexpression of complex parametric equations, and specification of operational scenarios for\r\ntesting requirements including design configurations and scenario drivers. Furthermore, the\r\napproach is automated in the sense that the analysis models can be executed. The execution of\r\nthe parametric diagrams is done with a parametric solver, where the execution of the behavioral\r\ndiagrams is done with a simulation engine based on standard execution semantics.\r\n\r\nAn overview of system level simulation in general and the purpose of this model in particular you can find in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLa8IVuJeBc)\r\n\r\n",
